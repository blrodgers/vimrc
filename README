vimrc

If you don't know what a vimrc file is for, please go learn more about the VIM editor.  This repo won't be of any use to you until you are at least slightly comfortable in VIM. 

This is my general purpose vimrc.  It is the one I use for my personal logins that won't see alot of heavy programming.  It's also the starting point for all my professional/personal programming vimrcs. I usually create a seperate login account for each type of development (sometimes even each project) I work on, and I put different plugins/scripts to work in each.  I find having a nice, clean home folder and a toolchain customized to what I'm working on improves my productivity significantly. 

There are many great VIM plugins available to help you do almost any kind of editing more efficiently. The one's listed in this vimrc are all available on github.  I wouldn't be nearly as efficient in my programming if it wasn't for the excellent work of these plugins' authors.  Thank you all so much.
